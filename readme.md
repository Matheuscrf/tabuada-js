🧮 Multiplication Table (tabuada-js)

A simple and interactive multiplication table generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Enter a number and a desired range — the app dynamically displays the multiplication results.

This project was created for practicing JavaScript DOM manipulation and form handling.

📌 Features

🔹 Input fields for base number and multiplicator maximum

🔹 Generates multiplication results dynamically

🔹 Clean and responsive UI

🔹 Prevents invalid form submissions

🚀 How It Works

User enters a number and a maximum multiplicator.

On form submission, JavaScript calculates the results.

Each multiplication step is rendered as a DOM element below the form.

The page updates without reloading using DOM manipulation.

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5 — Markup for layout and structure

CSS3 — Basic styling

JavaScript (ES6+) — Core logic & DOM manipulation

💡 Example

If you enter 5 with 10 as the multiplicator, the output will be:

5 x 1 = 5  
5 x 2 = 10  
...  
5 x 10 = 50

🎯 Purpose

This project is a hands-on exercise to reinforce core JavaScript fundamentals:

✔ DOM manipulation
